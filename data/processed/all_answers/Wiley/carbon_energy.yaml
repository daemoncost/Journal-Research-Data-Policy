    text: Research Data Policy (RDP) exists.
    explanation: "Wiley\u2019s Data Sharing Policies\n\nWiley is committed to a more\
      \ open research landscape, facilitating faster and more effective research discovery\
      \ by enabling reproducibility and verification of data, methodology and reporting\
      \ standards. We encourage authors of articles published in our journals to share\
      \ their research data including, but not limited to: raw data, processed data,\
      \ software, algorithms, protocols, methods, materials.\n\nRefer to the table\
      \ below to understand the various standardized data sharing policy categories:\n\
      \n\t\n\nData availability statement is published1\n\t\n\nData has been shared2\n\
      \t\n\nData has been peer reviewed3\n\t\n\nExample Wiley journals\n\nEncourages\

      \nGeoscience Data Journal\nAmerican Journal of Political Science\n\n1 A data\
      \ availability statement confirms the presence or absence of shared data.\n\n\
      2 Links to data in data availability statements are checked to ensure they link\
      \ to the data that the authors intended. If data have been shared in a data\
      \ repository, the data availability statement includes a permanent link to the\
      \ data. Shared data is also cited.\n\n3 Quality and/or replicability of linked\
      \ data are peer reviewed. Depending on the journal, this may be to peer review\
      \ the quality of the data by ensuring that the results in the paper and the\
      \ data in the repository align (for example, sample sizes and variables match),\
      \ or it may be to peer review the replicability of the data to ensure that the\
      \ claims presented in the journal article are valid and can be reproduced.\n\
      \nEncourages Data Sharing\n\nThe journal encourages authors to share the data\
      \ and other artefacts supporting the results in the paper by archiving it in\
      \ an appropriate public repository. Authors may provide a data availability\
      \ statement, including a link to the repository they have used, in order that\
      \ this statement can be published in their paper. Shared data should be cited.\
      \ All accepted manuscripts may elect to publish a data availability statement\
      \ to confirm the presence or absence of shared data. For authors who have shared\
      \ data: this statement will describe how the data can be accessed, and include\
      \ a persistent identifier (e.g., a DOI for the data, or an accession number)\
      \ from the repository where you shared the data. You may use the Standard Templates\
      \ for Author Use or draft your own.\n\nExpects Data Sharing\n\nThe journal expects\
      \ that data supporting the results in the paper will be archived in an appropriate\
      \ public repository. Authors are required to provide a data availability statement\
      \ to describe the availability or the absence of shared data. When data have\
      \ been shared, authors are required to include in their data availability statement\
      \ a link to the repository they have used, and to cite the data they have shared.\
      \ Whenever possible the scripts and other artefacts used to generate the analyses\
      \ presented in the paper should also be publicly archived. If sharing data compromises\
      \ ethical standards or legal requirements then authors are not expected to share\
      \ it.\n\nSee the Standard Templates for Author Use section below to select an\
      \ appropriate data availability statement for your dataset.\n\nMandates Data\
      \ Sharing\n\nThe journal requires, as a condition for publication, that the\
      \ data supporting the results in the paper will be archived in an appropriate\
      \ public repository. Authors are required to provide a data availability statement,\
      \ including a link to the repository they have used, and to cite the data they\
      \ have shared. Whenever possible the scripts and other artefacts used to generate\
      \ the analyses presented in the paper should also be publicly archived. Exceptions\
      \ may be granted at the discretion of the editor, for example, if sharing data\
      \ compromises privacy of human data, ethical standards or legal requirements.\
      \ If authors are unable to share data (for example, if sharing data compromises\
      \ ethical standards or legal requirements) then authors are not required to\
      \ share it and must describe restrictions in their data availability statement.\n\
      \nSee the Standard Templates for Author Use section below to select an appropriate\
      \ data availability statement for your dataset.\n\nMandates Data Sharing and\
      \ Peer Reviews Data\n\nThe journal requires, as a condition for publication,\
      \ that the data supporting the results in the paper will be peer reviewed and\
      \ archived in an appropriate public repository. Authors are required to provide\
      \ a data availability statement, including a link to the repository they have\
      \ used, and to cite the data they have shared. Whenever possible the scripts\
      \ and other artefacts used to generate the analyses presented in the paper should\
      \ also be publicly archived. Exceptions may be granted at the discretion of\
      \ the editor. If sharing data compromises ethical standards or legal requirements\
      \ then authors are not required to share it.\n\nAnd:\n\nPeer review of empirical\
      \ data will be conducted to confirm the quality of the shared data, for example,\
      \ that sample sizes match, that the variables described in the article are present\
      \ as fields in the data repository, that data is complete; that data is properly\
      \ labelled and described; and that it has the appropriate metadata for the kind\
      \ of data being shared.\n\nOr:\n\nPeer review of empirical data will be conducted\
      \ to confirm that the data reproduce the analytic results reported in the paper.\n\
      \nStandard Templates for Author Use\n\nBelow is a list of standard templates\
      \ for the text that will appear in the \"Data Availability Statement\" portion\
      \ of your article.. These statements adhere to guidelines set forth to comply\
      \ with journals that have an \"Expects Data\" or \"Mandates Data\" policy.\n\
