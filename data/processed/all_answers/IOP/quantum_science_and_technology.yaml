    text: Data sharing encouraged but optional.
    explanation: "From the RDP:\n\n\"Authors are encouraged to share their data but\
      \ not required to. However, if your data will not be made publicly available\
      \ then there are two related requirements:\n1) Authors must specify the reason\
      \ why they are unable to make their research data publicly available at the\
      \ point of publication and this reason will be included in the published article.\
      \ Further information about this requirement is set out below.\n2) Authors must\
      \ agree to make any data required to support or replicate claims made in an\
      \ article available privately to the journal\u2019s editors, reviewers and readers\
      \ without undue restriction or delay if requested.\"\n\nThey write authors are\
      \ not required to share data, but in point (2) they also write that requested\
      \ data must be made available upon request. So I seleced the weaker option \"\
      Data sharing encouraged but optional\", even though the third option could also\
      \ fit."
