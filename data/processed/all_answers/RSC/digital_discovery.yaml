    text: Additional data or code referee (referee that solely confirms that code
      and data are shared following the RDP).
    explanation: "The code and/or data central to the main findings of the study once\
      \ deposited or shared confidentially with reviewers are being reviewed to ensure\
      \ their reproducibility and reusability. On Digital Discovery we invite a data\
      \ reviewer (in addition to the regular two reviewers) who verifies that the\
      \ code is functional and reproduces the reported findings. They also check if\
      \ the data and/or code are appropriately presented and documented.\n\nPlease\
      \ inform the editor if: You wish to see any supporting data not submitted for\
      \ publication, or any previous unpublished paper,\nAlso:\nSupplementary information\
      \ (SI) +\n\nReviewers are asked to assess any ESI that is submitted alongside\
      \ a manuscript. ESI is classed as any Electronic Supplementary Information that\
      \ provides additional or supporting information, as well as other file/media\
      \ types, including large data sets, movies etc. Please check that appropriate\
      \ material is published as ESI rather than being included in the article. Any\
      \ ESI supplied upon submission must be reviewed thoroughly, and to the same\
      \ standard as the article.\n\nReviewers should refer to the Royal Society of\
      \ Chemistry ESI guidelines, which explain in more detail our requirements for\
      \ publication.\n \nAuthentication of new compounds +\n\nNot all papers will\
      \ contain Spectroscopic Information, and even among those journals that do,\
      \ guidelines can vary significantly. It is therefore very important to refer\
      \ to the individual journal specific guidelines, which explain in more detail\
      \ our requirements for publication. Spectroscopic information can often be located\
      \ in the ESI that has been submitted with the manuscript. Please make sure that\
      \ the ESI is checked thoroughly so as not to miss important data.\n\nSpectroscopic\
      \ information necessary for the assignment of a structure should normally be\
      \ given. How complete this information must be depends upon the circumstances;\
      \ the structure of a compound obtained from an unusual reaction or isolated\
      \ from a natural source needs much stronger supporting evidence than one derived\
      \ by a standard reaction from a precursor with an undisputed structure.\n\n\
      Reviewers are asked to assess the evidence in support of the homogeneity and\
      \ structure of all new compounds. No hard and fast rules can be laid down to\
      \ cover all types of compounds. For example, an accurate mass measurement of\
      \ a molecular ion does not provide evidence of purity of a compound and must\
      \ be accompanied by independent evidence of homogeneity (for example, HPLC).\n\
      \ \nX-ray crystallographic work +\n\nNot all papers will contain X-ray crystallographic\
      \ work, so it is important to refer to the individual journal specific guidelines\
      \ and X-ray crystallography guidelines which explain in more detail our requirements\
      \ for publication. Papers containing X-ray crystallographic work will be reviewed\
      \ for their chemical interest. When reviewing manuscripts containing crystal\
      \ structures, reviewers are not usually expected to fully check the crystal\
      \ data for accuracy, but should pay attention to the quality of the experimental\
      \ crystallographic work. The editor may also choose to send the manuscript to\
      \ a specialist crystallographer for specific crystallographic review.\n\nIn\
      \ a Communication a structure must usually be fully refined. For a Full paper,\
      \ partial refinement may be sufficient if only being used to establish connectivity,\
      \ confirm a trend or if the full structure has previously been published as\
      \ a Communication, at the editor\u2019s discretion. These Full papers must reference\
      \ the original Communication and relevant CCDC/ICSD numbers. If the crystallography\
      \ is discussed again at length in the Full paper, the data should be presented\
      \ in full and, where necessary, redeposited with the CCDC.\n\nIn some Full papers\
      \ where the results of a crystal structure determination are discussed but details\
      \ or extensive discussion are considered unnecessary, the data relating to the\
      \ crystal structure determination may be included as electronic supplementary\
      \ information (ESI), rather than discussed in detail in the manuscript. This\
      \ is acceptable if there is enough data in the ESI to allow reviewers/crystallographers\
      \ to confirm the reported results, and if it does not lead to unnecessary fragmentation\
      \ of the work.\n"
