    text: Data sharing policy mentioned in refereeing guidelines.
    explanation: "Please inform the editor if: You wish to see any supporting data\
      \ not submitted for publication, or any previous unpublished paper,\nAlso:\n\
      Supplementary information (SI) +\n\nReviewers are asked to assess any ESI that\
      \ is submitted alongside a manuscript. ESI is classed as any Electronic Supplementary\
      \ Information that provides additional or supporting information, as well as\
      \ other file/media types, including large data sets, movies etc. Please check\
      \ that appropriate material is published as ESI rather than being included in\
      \ the article. Any ESI supplied upon submission must be reviewed thoroughly,\
      \ and to the same standard as the article.\n\nReviewers should refer to the\
      \ Royal Society of Chemistry ESI guidelines, which explain in more detail our\
      \ requirements for publication.\n \nAuthentication of new compounds +\n\nNot\
      \ all papers will contain Spectroscopic Information, and even among those journals\
      \ that do, guidelines can vary significantly. It is therefore very important\
      \ to refer to the individual journal specific guidelines, which explain in more\
      \ detail our requirements for publication. Spectroscopic information can often\
      \ be located in the ESI that has been submitted with the manuscript. Please\
      \ make sure that the ESI is checked thoroughly so as not to miss important data.\n\
      \nSpectroscopic information necessary for the assignment of a structure should\
      \ normally be given. How complete this information must be depends upon the\
      \ circumstances; the structure of a compound obtained from an unusual reaction\
      \ or isolated from a natural source needs much stronger supporting evidence\
      \ than one derived by a standard reaction from a precursor with an undisputed\
      \ structure.\n\nReviewers are asked to assess the evidence in support of the\
      \ homogeneity and structure of all new compounds. No hard and fast rules can\
      \ be laid down to cover all types of compounds. For example, an accurate mass\
      \ measurement of a molecular ion does not provide evidence of purity of a compound\
      \ and must be accompanied by independent evidence of homogeneity (for example,\
      \ HPLC).\n \nX-ray crystallographic work +\n\nNot all papers will contain X-ray\
      \ crystallographic work, so it is important to refer to the individual journal\
      \ specific guidelines and X-ray crystallography guidelines which explain in\
      \ more detail our requirements for publication. Papers containing X-ray crystallographic\
      \ work will be reviewed for their chemical interest. When reviewing manuscripts\
      \ containing crystal structures, reviewers are not usually expected to fully\
      \ check the crystal data for accuracy, but should pay attention to the quality\
      \ of the experimental crystallographic work. The editor may also choose to send\
      \ the manuscript to a specialist crystallographer for specific crystallographic\
      \ review.\n\nIn a Communication a structure must usually be fully refined. For\
      \ a Full paper, partial refinement may be sufficient if only being used to establish\
      \ connectivity, confirm a trend or if the full structure has previously been\
      \ published as a Communication, at the editor\u2019s discretion. These Full\
      \ papers must reference the original Communication and relevant CCDC/ICSD numbers.\
      \ If the crystallography is discussed again at length in the Full paper, the\
      \ data should be presented in full and, where necessary, redeposited with the\
      \ CCDC.\n\nIn some Full papers where the results of a crystal structure determination\
      \ are discussed but details or extensive discussion are considered unnecessary,\
      \ the data relating to the crystal structure determination may be included as\
      \ electronic supplementary information (ESI), rather than discussed in detail\
      \ in the manuscript. This is acceptable if there is enough data in the ESI to\
      \ allow reviewers/crystallographers to confirm the reported results, and if\
      \ it does not lead to unnecessary fragmentation of the work.\n"
