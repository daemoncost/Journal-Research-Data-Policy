    explanation: "Some research communities are served by specific data repositories;\
      \ your institutional librarian, funder, or journal editor may make a recommendation.\
      \ Researchers can also use a general repository \u2013 such as Zenodo, figshare\
      \ or Dryad \u2013 that accept data from all disciplines.\n\nAIP Publishing authors\
      \ may host their data in their institutional or project specific repository.\n\
      \nYou can either deposit your datasets in a publicly available repository (where\
      \ available or appropriate) or you can present them in the manuscript.\n\nData\
      \ tables and/or text that are too long or may be of limited interest to readers\
      \ can be included as \u201Csupplementary material,\u201D which can aid the reviewer\
      \ and be accessed by readers online after publication.\n\nCompulsory: Structural\
      \ Data for Biological Macromolecules: Authors reporting new crystal structures\
      \ need to deposit the atomic coordinates and related experimental data (i.e.,\
      \ structure factor amplitudes/intensities, NMR restraints) in a member site\
      \ of the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB)."
