    explanation: "Some research communities are served by specific data repositories;\
      \ your institutional librarian, funder, or journal editor may make a recommendation.\
      \ Researchers can also use a general repository \u2013 such as Zenodo, figshare\
      \ or Dryad \u2013 that accept data from all disciplines.\n\nAIP Publishing authors\
      \ may host their data in their institutional or project specific repository.\n\
      \nYou can either deposit your datasets in a publicly available repository (where\
      \ available or appropriate) or you can present them in the manuscript.\n\nData\
      \ tables and/or text that are too long or may be of limited interest to readers\
      \ can be included as \u201Csupplementary material,\u201D which can aid the reviewer\

    text: Code sharing required.
    explanation: All papers on new potential energy surfaces need to be accompanied
      by a tape archive (e.g., PES.tar) file. The PES.tar (tape archive file) should
      contain a computer program that can be used to generate the potential and preferably
      also its forces for use in classical trajectory calculations. If the manuscript
      is accepted for publication, the PES.tar file will be published as supplementary
      material.

      were used to run computational experiments.
    explanation: The computer program can be written in any modern computer language,
      but the compiler that the authors used (including its version number) needs
      to be specified, and the program needs to be accompanied by example input and
      output files that reproduce some of the key results presented in the paper.
