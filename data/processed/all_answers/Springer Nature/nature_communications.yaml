    text: Research Data Policy (RDP) exists.
    explanation: 'At Springer Nature we advance discovery by publishing trusted research,
      supporting the development of new ideas and championing open science. We also
      aim to facilitate compliance with research funder and institution requirements
      to share data.


      To help accomplish this we have established a standard research data policy
      for our journals, based on transparency around supporting data. This policy
      applies to all datasets that are necessary to interpret and replicate the conclusions
      reported in a research article.'

    text: Code sharing encouraged but optional.
    explanation: "The focus of this policy framework is on data rather than software\
      \ but the sharing of software alongside data is also important to support reproducibility\
      \ and transparency. Many Springer Nature journals also support the use of Code\
      \ Availability Statements. Please consult the journal\u2019s submission guidance\
      \ or contact the journal directly for information on code sharing and code availability.\n\
      [From Springer-Nature RDP]\n\n------------------------------\n\nFor all studies\
      \ using custom code or mathematical algorithm that is deemed central to the\
      \ conclusions, a statement must be included under the heading \"Code availability\"\
      , indicating whether and how the code or algorithm can be accessed, including\
      \ any restrictions to access. Code availability statements should be provided\
      \ as a separate section after the data availability statement but before the\
      \ references.\n\nUpon publication, Nature Portfolio journals consider it best\
      \ practice to release custom computer code in a way that allows readers to repeat\
      \ the published results.\n\nNature journals encourage researchers who submit\
      \ papers that rely on bespoke software to provide the programs for peer review.\n\
      \nPapers in Nature Portfolio journals should make computer code accessible where\
      \ possible.\n\n[From Nature Portfolio additional policies: https://www.nature.com/nature/editorial-policies/reporting-standards]"
