    text: Research Data Policy (RDP) exists.
    explanation: 'At Springer Nature we advance discovery by publishing trusted research,
      supporting the

      development of new ideas and championing open science. We also aim to facilitate

      compliance with research funder and institution requirements to share data.


      To help accomplish this we have established a standard research data policy
      for our

      journals, based on transparency around supporting data. This policy applies
      to all datasets

      that are necessary to interpret and replicate the conclusions reported in a
      research article.'

      failing this within the manuscript or additional supporting files. See our repository
      guidance

      for more information.


      For a number of data types, submission to a community-endorsed, public repository
      is

      mandatory. See our list of mandated data types.'
