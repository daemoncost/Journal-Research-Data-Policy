    text: Research Data Policy (RDP) exists.
    explanation: 'At Springer Nature we advance discovery by publishing trusted research,
      supporting the

      development of new ideas and championing open science. We also aim to facilitate

      compliance with research funder and institution requirements to share data.


      To help accomplish this we have established a standard research data policy
      for our

      journals, based on transparency around supporting data. This policy applies
      to all datasets

      that are necessary to interpret and replicate the conclusions reported in a
      research article.'

      ---------------------

      SPECIAL NOTE CONCERNING SCIENTIFIC REPORTS:


      Sharing datasets

      A condition of publication in Scientific Reports is that authors make materials,
      data and associated protocols promptly available to others without preconditions.


      Datasets must be made freely available to readers from the date of publication
      and must be provided to Editorial Board Members and referees at submission,
      for the purposes of evaluating the manuscript.

      -----------------------

      NONETHELESS, A POSSIBLE DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT THAT IS ALLOWED READS:

      "The datasets generated during and/or analysed during the current study are
      available from the corresponding author on reasonable request."'
