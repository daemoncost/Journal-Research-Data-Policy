    explanation: 'Data Sharing Policy


      This journal applies the Taylor & Francis share upon reasonable request data
      sharing policy. Authors agree to make data and materials supporting the results
      or analyses presented in their paper available upon reasonable request. It is
      up to the author to determine whether a request is reasonable. Authors are required
      to cite any data sets referenced in the article and provide a Data Availability
      Statement. Please note that data should only be shared if it is ethically correct
      to do so, where this does not violate the protection of human subjects, or other
      valid ethical, privacy, or security concerns.


      At the point of submission, you will be asked if there is a data set associated
      with the paper. If you reply yes, you will be required to provide the DOI, pre-registered
      DOI, hyperlink, or other persistent identifier associated with the data set(s).
      If you have selected to provide a pre-registered DOI, please be prepared to
      share the reviewer URL associated with your data deposit, upon request by reviewers.


      Where one or multiple data sets are associated with a manuscript, these are
      not formally peer reviewed as a part of the journal submission process. It is
      the author''s responsibility to ensure the soundness of data. Any errors in
      the data rest solely with the producers of the data set(s).'

    text: Data sharing required but not publicly (e.g. available upon request is allowed).
    explanation: 'Depositing data


      Authors are required to respond to data sharing requests in association with
      their paper following publication.


      We recommend authors deposit data in a recognized data repository before submission.
      This can facilitate the ease of sharing on receipt of requests (which could
      be months or years after publication). We recommend choosing a repository that
      can mint a persistent digital identifier, such as a digital object identifier
      (DOI). It should also recognise a long-term preservation plan.


      We highly encourage researchers to consider the FAIR Data Principles when depositing
      data. We further advise researchers to use FAIRsharing and re3data.org to search
      for a suitable repository. These both provide a list of certified data repositories.'
