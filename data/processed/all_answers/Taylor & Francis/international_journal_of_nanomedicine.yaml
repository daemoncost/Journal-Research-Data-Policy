      \ Press journals from July 1st, 2018, reporting on clinical trial data must\
      \ contain a data sharing statement indicating:\n\n    Whether the authors intend\
      \ to share individual deidentified participant data;\n    What specific data\
      \ they intend to share;\n    What other study-related documents will be made\
      \ available;\n    How the data will be accessible;\n    When and for how long\
      \ they will be made available.\n\nSee the ICMJE guidelines on data sharing and\
      \ example given in the Table.\n\nClinical trials that begin enrolling participants\
      \ on or after 1 January 2019 must include a data sharing plan in the trial\u2019\
      s registration. Any deviations from this plan must be disclosed in the data\
      \ sharing statement when published."

    explanation: "FAIR data \n\nWe encourage all researchers to consider the FAIR\
      \ Data Principles when depositing data, to maximize its use. FAIR data is: \n\
      \nFindable: includes rich metadata and a persistent identified (e.g. DOI) so\
      \ that others can easily find and discover it.\n\nAccessible: the data and metadata\
      \ are understandable, so machines and humans can read and process it. Data also\
      \ needs to be located in a trustworthy repository which preserves them in perpetuity.\n\
      \nInteroperable: the metadata are expressed in a formal, accessible, shared,\
      \ and broadly applicable language, allowing sharing between different systems.\n\
      \nReusable: data have a clear and accessible usage license that specifies reuse.\n\
      \nFor more information on FAIR data read the FAIR data principles. "

    text: Mentioned in the RDP but optional.
    explanation: Where community-endorsed mandates exist for submission of data to
      public repositories, authors should submit the datasets to the appropriate repositories
      and provide the accession numbers (where available) in the paper. Authors should
      include a statement in their manuscript about where the data can be found and
      provide links to the publicly archived datasets. The statement of data availability
      should explain which additional unpublished data from the study, if any, are
      available, to whom, and how these can be obtained. These datasets can also be
      cited in the reference list and this is particularly encouraged when the datasets
      have a Digital Object Identifier (DOI). In cases where authors do not wish to
      share their data or are unable to do so, they should state that data will not
      be shared and the reasons why.
