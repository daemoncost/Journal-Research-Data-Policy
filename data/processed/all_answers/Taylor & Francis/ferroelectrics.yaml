    explanation: This journal supports Open Science Badges. The Open Science Badges
      program was designed by the Center for Open Science (COS) to acknowledge open
      science practices. Badges are offered as incentives for researchers to share
      data, materials, or to preregister, and are a signal to the reader that the
      content of the study has been made available in perpetuity
