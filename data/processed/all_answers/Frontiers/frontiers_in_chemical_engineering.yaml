    text: Research Data Policy (RDP) exists.
    explanation: We strongly encourage sharing the maximal amount of data; however
      where ethical, legal or privacy issues are present the data should not be shared.
      In cases where some or all data cannot be shared for legal, ethical or privacy
      restrictions, the authors should make these limitations clear in the Data Availability
      Statement at the time of submission. In situations where access is restricted
      to protect confidential or proprietary information, authors are required to
      explain the restrictions on the dataset and make the data available upon request
      with permission of the third party. The Data Availability Statement should include
      all necessary contact information to request access to the dataset.

    text: Data sharing policy mentioned in refereeing guidelines.
    explanation: Reviewers are subject experts and evaluate manuscripts by using the
      quality assessment tool and designated review questionnaire that prioritize
      scientific quality, rigor, and validity. They evaluate the methodology of a
      study for solidity and rigor, and ensure the research provides valid conclusions
      and is supported by sufficient data.
