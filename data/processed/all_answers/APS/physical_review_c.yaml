    text: Data sharing policy not mentioned in refereeing guidelines.
    explanation: "Guidelines for Referees\n\nReferees play a crucial role in evaluating\
      \ manuscripts submitted to the Physical Review journals. Physical Review editors\
      \ work closely with referees to apply the acceptance criteria stringently and\
      \ to act promptly in accepting or rejecting manuscripts. Your active collaboration\
      \ as a referee is central to the success of the journals.\nInvitation to Review\n\
      \nThe email invitation to review includes links to accept or decline. Before\
      \ you accept, please ensure that the manuscript content is close enough to your\
      \ area of expertise to allow you to provide useful input and a prompt review.\
      \ If that is not the case, please decline; your suggestions for alternate reviewers\
      \ are welcomed.\n\nConfidentiality\n\nAll materials associated with the review\
      \ process are confidential, including the manuscript, Supplemental Material,\
      \ author-provided material, referee reports, and other correspondence. These\
      \ materials must remain confidential when you consult with colleagues or invite\
      \ them to write a joint report. We ask that you include the names and contact\
      \ information of any colleagues who help in writing the report. When you are\
      \ reviewing a manuscript, please do not initiate discussions with the author(s);\
      \ instead, please contact the editors with your inquiry.\n\nIt is vitally important\
      \ for reviewers to disclose any conflicts of interest to the editors. Please\
      \ let them know if you have a direct competitive, collaborative, or other relationship\
      \ with an author that could preclude your objective evaluation of the manuscript.\
      \ It is unethical for you to use the content of a manuscript sent to you for\
      \ review for your own scientific purposes. The Physical Review journals are\
      \ members of the Committee on Publication Ethics and follow its guidelines.\
      \ See also Appropriate Use of AI-Based Writing Tools.\n\nReviewing the Manuscript\
      \ and Writing the Report\n\nThe following guidelines are an aid to help when\
      \ reviewing the manuscript. Read the referral letter carefully; there may be\
      \ editor comments and questions, and/or reference material and previous correspondence\
      \ sent with the referral. When writing your report, use clear, simple wording\
      \ and avoid overly negative or polemical comments.\n\nWe suggest dividing your\
      \ review into three parts: (I) Comments intended for both the author(s) and\
      \ the editors; (II) Recommendation; (III) Comments to the editors only.\n\n\
      Comments intended for both the author(s) and the editors:\n\nBriefly summarize\
      \ the manuscript. The summary could include a statement on the key results and\
      \ how they add to the field.\nAssess the originality and significance of the\
      \ results.\nAssess the technical quality and scientific rigor of the manuscript.\n\
      Is the work well executed and technically correct?\nAre the models or approximations\
      \ used sufficiently justified?\nAre the main conclusions or claims well supported?\n\
      Is the section for which this manuscript is being considered (Regular Article,\
      \ Letter, or Comment) the right venue for this work? Be aware that some sections\
      \ have length limits.\nIf submitted as a Letter, does the work\u2019s quality\
      \ and importance justify being featured in this special section?\nAssess the\
      \ manuscript\u2019s presentation.\nAre the title and abstract informative, concise,\
      \ and clear?\nIs the manuscript well organized and clearly written?\nIs the\
      \ description of the technical content sufficiently comprehensive?\nAre the\
      \ references to the literature appropriate and adequate?\nDoes the content of\
      \ the manuscript justify its length? Please be specific as to how and where\
      \ the manuscript could be expanded or shortened.\nAre the figures and tables\
      \ clear, useful, and suitably summarized in the captions? Is there duplication\
      \ from previous publications?\nAssess the content and quality of the Supplemental\
      \ Material. Is the information included supplemental or essential for understanding\
      \ the manuscript? Should any of it be included in the main text?\nWhen writing\
      \ your report, please formulate it in gender-neutral terms. If unavoidable,\
      \ please use the singular \u201Cthey/them/theirs\u201D in place of gender-specific\
      \ pronouns.\n\nRecommendation: Your report should include a recommendation to\
      \ accept, revise and reconsider, or reject the manuscript. Please provide reasons\
      \ for your recommendation.\n\nComments intended for the Editors only: When submitting\
      \ your report, you will be presented with a table of checkboxes where you can\
      \ summarize your overall view of the manuscript for the editors. Here you can\
      \ indicate your recommendation on accepting or rejecting the manuscript, and,\
      \ if appropriate, suggest that the paper be transferred to another Physical\
      \ Review journal or submitted elsewhere. This section is where you may include\
      \ confidential remarks for the editor. These comments may include your thoughts\
      \ on why the paper is right or wrong for the particular journal, reasons behind\
      \ your recommendation, or other information you feel would be useful."

    text: No mention of automatic testing to verify code functionality.
    explanation: Data Availability Statements Sharing data supports new research and
      the independent verification of findings. The Physical Review journals strongly
      encourage authors to share relevant data, code, software, and other materials
      that support their reported results by depositing them in open data repositories
      at the time of publication. Delays in sharing these materials may be appropriate
      in certain circumstances in order to respect privacy, trade secrets, or national
      security. In addition to these recommendations, authors should follow requirements
      for sharing data and code set by their funding agencies. Authors should, when
      possible, include a Data Availability Statement in the paragraph before the
      Acknowledgments that indicates the availability of data, software, code, and
      other materials. The statement should reference relevant data policies from
      funders and institutions. It should also provide a reference to the data, which
      includes the authors (creators) of the data, the year, any version number, the
      name of the repository (if applicable), and a persistent identifier, preferably
      a DOI. If the data have a corresponding article published in a data journal,
      then the reference to the journal data should be included as well.
