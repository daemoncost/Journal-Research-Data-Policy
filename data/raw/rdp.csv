Data Requirements
Characterization of New Substances. Adequate evidence to firmly establish both identity and purity should be provided. Recommended criteria vary according to substance categories. A summary of the detailed criteria may be found below.

Guidelines for Characterization of Organometallic and Inorganic Compounds
Authors are required to provide sufficient information (as described in more detail below) to establish the identity of a new compound, its purity, and its yield. Sufficient experimental details must also be included to allow another researcher to reproduce the synthesis. Characterization data and experimental details must be included in either the paper or the Supporting Information. It must be emphasized that the following is only a general guideline and authors are encouraged to present as much data as possible to support their structure assignments. In some cases, a reviewer or Editor may require authors to submit additional data to satisfy themselves of the validity of a proposed formulation.

Characterization Data

(a) Routine Compounds

Compounds in this category are those that have either literature precedents or are obtained by a logical synthesis in close to quantitative yield. Because of potential misidentification of atoms, an X-ray diffraction structure alone will not typically be considered to provide sufficient characterization for these molecules. Diamagnetic compounds must also be characterized by NMR spectroscopy, preferably for at least two different nuclei. In addition, at least one other characterization technique must be used to support the proposed formulation. Preferably, this would be a technique that provides definitive identification of a key functional group or chromophore. For example, IR spectroscopy may be used to support the presence of carbonyl, acyl, dinitrogen, carbonyl, and hydride moieties.

Paramagnetic compounds of this category present a further complication if NMR spectroscopy does not furnish clear evidence for the proposed formulation (note that NMR spectroscopy of paramagnetic complexes can be useful if sufficiently large sweep widths are used). In many cases, X-ray diffraction may provide the most unambiguous characterization of such complexes, but this will not suffice as the only means of characterization. In the absence of an X-ray structure determination, evidence for elemental constitution must be provided by elemental analysis (e.g., combustion analysis, microprobe analysis), or mass spectrometry. Magnetic moment and/or ESR spectroscopic data should also be given for paramagnetic compounds if it is considered that the spin state of the molecule is of especial interest.

(b) Novel or Unexpected Compounds

Compounds in this category are those that either (i) exhibit an unprecedented type of structure, or (ii) are obtained by unexpected reaction. Such compounds require more detailed characterization to ensure their validity. In select instances, a variety of definitive spectroscopic techniques may provide sufficient characterization (for example, if many of the nuclei are NMR active), but in the majority of cases evidence for elemental constitution must be provided by either elemental analysis (e.g. combustion analysis, microprobe analysis), or mass spectrometry. While an X-ray diffraction structure is not considered definitive proof of elemental composition, it is acceptable evidence for composition providing that the results of other physical methods concerning the characterization are conclusive.

(c) Solid State Materials

Compounds in this category are those that have no existence in solution. While X-ray diffraction may provide the most unambiguous characterization of such compounds, evidence for elemental constitution and homogeneity needs to be presented. Atom ratios as determined by, for example, microprobe analysis of selected elements may be sufficient for this purpose

(d) Compounds that have not been isolated

Compounds that have not been isolated in pure form (e.g. reaction intermediates or intractable mixtures, or unstable species) may be published. However, in these circumstances, an explicit statement must be given indicating that the compounds have not been isolated. Only in exceptional circumstances will a paper be published in which none of the new compounds reported has been isolated and fully characterized.

Purity and Yield

The yield and purity of all compounds must be reported, including the methods used to determine them. The yield of a compound obtained in an NMR tube reaction should be determined using an internal standard.

Guidelines for Characterization of Organic Compounds
Sample Quality

For new substances, evidence of the homogeneity the purified sample should be included. Elemental analysis is sufficient. If no analysis was performed, then other evidence (for example, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, hplc, glpc, gel electrophoresis, etc.) should be included as figures in the Supporting Information.

Molecular Weight

Evidence of molecular weight should be provided, especially if elemental analysis was not performed. Low resolution MS data under conditions that minimize fragmentation are acceptable. If there is a specific need to distinguish alternative formulas with the same molecular mass (within one amu), then HRMS data are necessary.

Miscellaneous

Numerical listings of characteristic spectroscopic data should be included to support assigned structures, changes in functionality, unusual chromophores, properties, etc. Methods of purification used to prepare samples for characterization should be described. For crystalline samples, information about the method of crystallization should be included (solvents; mp; etc.). For non-racemic, chiral substances, data to allow correlation of absolute configuration should be given, preferably including [α]D values. If correlation data are provided based on hplc or glpc methods, then retention times for both enantiomers must be provided, together with solvent and flow rate information, and identification of the chiral support.

Intermediates on Solid Phase; Combinatorial Chemistry

Validation of methods and characterization of new substances in a statistically significant sampling should be provided. Resin-bound intermediates need not be characterized if acceptable end product quality (as defined in A-C above) is demonstrated.

Spectra. Reproductions of spectra, or the relevant segments thereof, will be published only if concise numerical summaries are inadequate for the purposes of the paper. Papers dealing primarily with interpretation of spectra and those in which band shape or fine structure needs to be illustrated may be published with such spectra included. Spectra will not be published merely as adjuncts to the characterization of compounds, however. See ‘Supporting Information’ below. Routine infrared, electronic, NMR, and mass spectra of new compounds should be numerically summarized, as appropriate, in the Experimental Section of an Article or in the Supporting Information of a Communication.

Kinetic and Equilibrium Data. For publication in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, the reporting of kinetic data and equilibrium binding data for proteins, nucleic acids, and other species should preferably include a description of the identity of the catalyst or binding molecule, its origin, purity of composition, and any modifications such as mutations, post-translational modifications, or other modifications made to facilitate expression and purification. The method of assay and the exact experimental conditions of the assay should be provided as a reference to previous work, with or without modifications, or fully described if a new assay. Conditions essential to reproduce the results such as the temperature, pH, and pressure (if other than atmospheric) of the assay should be included. Terms such as “not detectable” (ND) should be avoided. Instead, an estimate of the limit of detection based on the sensitivity and error analysis of the assay should be provided. Authors are referred to the STRENDA (Standards for Reporting Enzymology Data) Commission of the Beilstein Institut (http://www.beilstein-institut.de/en/projects/strenda/guidelines) for an example of detailed guidelines.

Reporting and Stewardship of NMR Data. New guidelines recommend a standard baseline for the submission of NMR data to ACS journals. They are intended to promote accuracy and consistency. The guidelines are divided into three sections: NMR text, which outlines the preferred format for NMR data included in the Experimental Section; NMR spectra, which outlines the preferred format for inclusion of hard copies of spectra in the Supporting Information; and primary NMR data files, which outlines the procedure for submitting FID files, acquisition data, and processing parameters to include in the Supporting Information. Authors are strongly encouraged to provide all three sets of data for all new and/or key compounds described in a manuscript submission.

In the Experimental Section, the compound must be clearly identified, for example in a header at the beginning of the synthetic procedure or the summary of spectroscopic data. List the nucleus being measured, any nucleus being broad-band decoupled, the solvent used (formula preferred, e.g. C6D6 over benzene-d6), the standard used, and the field strength. Field strength should be noted for each spectrum, not as a comment in the general Experimental Section. The standard(s) may be specified in the general Experimental Section; as an example, 1H NMR data recorded in C6D6 listed as “residual internal C6D5H (δ 7.15)”. Indicate solvent or peak suppression protocols used in collecting data. List the probe temperature when it is accurately known; ambient probe temperature is otherwise understood. Give 1H NMR chemical shifts to two digits after the decimal point. Include the number of protons represented by the signal, peak multiplicity, and coupling constants as needed (J italicized, reported with up to one digit after the decimal). The number of bonds through which the coupling is operative, xJ, may be specified by the author if known with a high degree of certainty. Accepted abbreviations for multiplicities and descriptors are s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, quint = quintet, m = multiplet (denotes complex pattern), dd = doublet of doublets, dt = doublet of triplets, td = triplet of doublets, and br = broad signal.

Chemical shifts should be listed consistently in a single article, starting either from downfield to upfield or vice-versa. Assign peak identities under the following circumstances: non-decoupled or equivalent spectra have been collected (13C, 31P, etc.); 2-D experiments have been performed; or unambiguous assignment is possible without additional experiments, such as in the case of an organometallic metal-hydride 1H signal, PF6 vs MPPh3 31P signal, etc. Give 13C chemical shifts to one digit after the decimal point, unless an additional digit will help distinguish overlapping peaks. Include peak multiplicities for 1H-coupled 13C NMR spectra or for signals in 1H-decoupled spectra that are coupled to other magnetically active nuclei. A 13C NMR signal will be considered a singlet if the multiplicity is not assigned. Only rarely is a true multiplet observed in a 13C{1H} NMR spectrum. However, a certain region may contain a group of unresolved peaks or signals. Mention of unobserved resonances is encouraged.

Submission of spectra (.doc, .docx, .txt, .pdf, .tif) is strongly recommended for all new and/or key compounds, following these guidelines:

A caption should be included on the spectrum, noting the nucleus being measured, the solvent (formula preferred, e.g. C6D6  over benzene-d6) and the field strength.
A representation of the compound should be included on the spectrum—please use ChemDraw or a related program. The compound identifier used in the manuscript should be included.
The largest peak in the 1H NMR spectrum should normally arise from the compound, not the solvent.
All peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum should be integrated. Chemical shift values should be included.
The solvent peak should be clearly labeled on the spectrum.
All peaks should be visible on the spectrum. Insets are encouraged to show expanded regions. At minimum, the spectral window should be ‒1 ppm to 9 ppm for 1H NMR and ‒10 ppm to 180 ppm for 13C NMR.
Font should be clear and large enough to read (minimum of 10 point). Horizontal orientation is preferred for spectra.
Submission of primary NMR data files (FID files, acquisition data, processing parameters) is encouraged for all new and/or key compounds. When submitting these files, please consider the following guidelines:

One folder should be created for each compound. The folder should be named clearly, using the compound name (if available) and compound identifier, as referenced in the Experimental Section or Supporting Information. Include the FID files, acquisition data, and processing parameters for each experiment.
Name each spectrum according to the type of nucleus measured. 1H, 13C, DEPT, COSY, etc. NMR files should be compressed into zip files—please use multiple zip files if necessary. Files must be submitted in their native format. In a text document, include the name of the manufacturer of the spectrometer used to collect the data, the acquisition software and processing programs used to analyze the data, and the field strength used to measure each nucleus (i.e., 300 MHz 1H or 50 MHz 13C). Include a structure file that shows the structure and compound identifier for each provided dataset. MolFile is the recommended format and is strongly preferred.
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Pulse Sequences. For manuscripts that present new NMR pulse sequences, authors are requested to supply as “Supporting Information for Publication” a file that includes the original working pulse sequence information required to record data. This will typically include the pulse sequence code, parameter set, and other associated files, such as tables of gradient or pulse shapes.

Structural and Chemical Shift Data for Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Any set of atomic coordinates referred to in the manuscript, including atomic coordinates and structure factors for proteins determined by X-ray crystallography and coordinates determined by NMR, should be deposited with the Protein Data Bank, Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics at Rutgers University whenever appropriate. (Theoretical model depositions are no longer accepted for inclusion in the PDB archive.) If the coordinate files are not deposited in the PDB, or if the PDB files are on hold until publication, then the coordinate files must be included in the Supporting Information submitted concurrently with the manuscript. Requirements are similar for structures of nucleic acids, which should be deposited with the Nucleic Acid Database. A manuscript that does not provide coordinates at the time of submission will not be sent out for review. It is the responsibility of the author to obtain a file name (PDB ID or NDB ID) for the molecule; the file name must appear in the published manuscript. If a file name has not yet been obtained upon acceptance of a paper, it must be added in proof. Atomic coordinates and structure factors for all structures mentioned must be available immediately upon publication of the paper, either directly in the Supporting Information or as a data bank deposition. Similar requirements also apply to any chemical shifts referred to in the paper, whether they are only for assignment of resonances or used for any form of structure calculation. Those chemical shifts must be available to the reviewer at time of submission, either as an available entry in the Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank or included directly as Supporting Information.

Single Crystal Diffraction Data. Manuscripts reporting the determination of one or more structures by X-ray diffraction must adhere to the following requirements:

Abstract. The abstract may summarize geometric features of unusual interest but should not contain unit cell parameters.

Main Body of Manuscript. Tables of essential interatomic distances and angles are not required but may be submitted (metric information for standard structural components should not be included).

For structures with anisotropically refined atoms, a figure displaying the thermal ellipsoids should ordinarily be presented; a spherical-atom representation may be substituted if necessary for clarity. If a spherical atom view is chosen for the manuscript, a thermal ellipsoid figure should be included in the Supporting Information. In cases where intermolecular interactions are relevant to the discussion, a view of the unit cell may be included.

An Article should list for each structure the formula, formula weight, crystal system, space group, color of crystal, unit cell parameters, temperature of data collection, and values of Z, R, and GOF; a brief description of data collection and solution and refinement of the structure should be placed in the Experimental Section. Tables of atom coordinates and thermal parameters will not be printed.

Structure factors (except for proteins and nucleic acids) should not be submitted as Supporting Information. However, one printed table of structure factors should be retained in case it is requested by the Editor for review purposes only.

CIF Submission Instructions:
All Crystallographic Information Files (CIFs), structure factor tables, and CheckCIF reports must be submitted to the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC) prior to manuscript submission. See Requirements for Depositing X-Ray Crystallographic Data [PDF] for complete details on submission of CIFs and a list of file types accommodated by CCDC.

Before being submitted to CCDC, CIFs should be checked using the free checkCIF data-validation utility on the CIF Validation site.
Any reported syntax errors should be corrected. Authors are required to correct/defend/or respond to any A-level alerts. Comments may be inserted into the CIF file using a Validation Response Form or uploaded as a separate document as Supporting Information for Review Only.
checkCIF output files (combined into one PDF file) should be uploaded at submission as Supporting Information for Review Only.
Any subsequent revisions to the CIFs or structure factor tables should be deposited directly with the CCDC before resubmitting the manuscript in ACS Paragon Plus.
Powder Diffraction Data. The presentation of X-ray powder diffraction data for new materials or for materials previously uncharacterized by this technique is encouraged. Data from X-ray powder measurements should be accompanied by details of the experimental technique: source of X-rays, the radiation, its wavelength, filters or monochromators, camera diameter, the type of X-ray recording, and the technique for measuring intensities. In cases of unindexed listing of the data, the d spacings of all observed lines should be listed in sequence, together with their relative intensities. In cases where filtered radiation is used, every effort should be made to identify residual β lines. Where resolution into α1-α2 doublets occurs, the identification of the d spacing for each line as dα1, dα2 gives a measure of the quality of the diffraction pattern. When an indexing of the data is offered, the observed and calculated 1/d2 values should be listed along with the observed relative intensities (it is superfluous to give d spacings in this instance). All calculated 1/d2 values should be listed (exclusive of systematic absences), to the limit of the data quoted. If possible, the crystal system should be specified. Possible space groups may also be listed if the data warrant it. Relevant information about the specimen used should be included.

Magnetic Measurements. Fits of magnetic data [χ(T), χ-1(T), χT(T), μ(T), M(H), etc.] to an analytical expression must include both the Hamiltonian from which the analytical expression is derived and the final analytical expression and fitting parameters. When the value of an exchange coupling constant, J, is given in the abstract, the form of the Hamiltonian must also be included. The expressions may be included in the manuscript or, if long and complex, as Supporting Information; if the latter method is used, it should be noted in the Supporting Information paragraph at the end of the manuscript. In addition, how the sample was measured (in a gelatin capsule, Teflon capsule, etc.) and the diamagnetic correction for the sample holder, as well as the diamagnetic correction for the material, must be provided and the manner in which it was calculated (Pascal’s constants) or measured must be stated.

Computations. When computational results are an essential part of a manuscript, sufficient detail must be given, either within the paper or in the Supporting Information, to enable readers to reproduce the calculations. This includes data such as force field parameters and equations defining the model (or references to where such material is available in the open literature). If the software used for calculations is generally available, it must be properly cited in the References and Footnotes. References to the methods upon which the software is based must also be provided. Results obtained from methods or parameters that are not adequately described in the manuscript or in the literature are not acceptable for publication. Authors who report the results of electronic structure calculations are requested to provide as Supporting Information the geometries (either as Cartesian coordinates or Z matrices) of all the stationary points whose relative energies are given in the manuscript. The absolute energies in hartrees that are computed at these geometries should not be given in the manuscript but should be included in the Supporting Information.

Where possible, ACS recommends authors deposit data in discipline-specific, community-recognized repositories or in generalist repositories when no community resource is available. Authors should consult the journal Author Guidelines for specific repository recommendations or requirements for data types.

ACS strongly encourages authors to select a repository that issues a persistent unique identifier, such as a DOI or an Accession Number. This will help facilitate the discoverability and citation of deposited data. Repositories that focus on research data, are managed by a sustainable institution (such as a professional society or university), have a plan for long-term storage of and access to the data, and provide clear information about terms of use of the data are preferred.

Manuscripts submitted to these journals prior to September 15, 2022 will not be included in the pilot. A Data Availability Statement is not required for other ACS journals at this time but is highly encouraged. With results from the pilot program, ACS will decide on future requirements for all its journals.

Is a Data Availability Statement required for every article?
A Data Availability Statement is required for all peer-reviewed articles in Organic Letters, The Journal of Organic Chemistry, and ACS Organic & Inorganic Au. A Data Availability Statement is not required for the following non-peer-reviewed articles, but is encouraged if new data are being presented: Addition/Correction, Editorial, Expression of Concern, or Retraction.
",DOIs or other persistent identifiers recommended for datasets or codes.,"Data Availability Statements
A Data Availability Statement should describe the availability of the data underlying the conclusions drawn in the research article and provide a means of access, where applicable, by linking to the data, preferably through the use of a persistent identifier such as a DOI or an Accession Number assigned by a data repository. The Data Availability Statement should be included in the manuscript under the Associated Content heading with the Supporting Information.

Research data is defined as materials and information used in the experiments that enable the validation of the conclusions drawn in the article, including primary data produced by the authors for the study being reported, secondary data reused or analyzed by the authors for the study, and any other materials necessary to reproduce or replicate the results.

The ACS Research Data Policy provides additional information on Data Availability Statements, Data Citation, and Data Repositories.

",Data sharing encouraged but optional.,"Data Requirements
Particular attention should be given to ensuring that experimental procedures are reported in sufficient detail to allow full understanding by the expert reader to the extent that would allow ready reproduction of the experiments. (References to methods used in previous publications may be used, provided the details are very similar.) Technical details that are not essential, but would nevertheless be useful to anyone wanting to fully understand the experiments, may be included as Supporting Information. Rigorous attention to the control and measurement of experimental parameters should be described, including considerations of possible sources of systematic and statistical errors, such that the conclusions of the article may be fully justified. Careful consideration of significant figures (the number of digits that carry meaning relevant to the resolution of the measurement) should be given when reporting data in the abstract, text, and tables. It is especially important when describing device characterization to indicate how many devices were characterized and to differentiate between average, typical, and best-case results. The Virtual Issue on best practices for reporting the properties of materials and devices (http://pubs.acs.org/page/vi/best-practices.html ) provides useful guidance.

As part of the Supporting Information, authors must provide an electronic copy of the structural data as a Crystallographic Information File (CIF) and must clearly notify the Editor in the cover letter that the manuscript contains structural data. (See the journal homepage for further instructions.) A checkcif file for each structure should also be uploaded as supporting information for review (https://checkcif.iucr.org).  Authors must confirm that the data in the CIF file correspond to the structures reported in the manuscript. During the review process, the CIFs will be available only to the reviewers of the manuscript and will remain confidential.  Authors should note that the ACS does not forward coordinates to crystallographic databases such as the Fachinformationszentrum Karlsruhe (FIZ) or the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD). This is the responsibility of the author.

Below are the general guidelines from Pure Appl. Chem. 1998, 70, No. 10, 2047–2049 (http://dx.doi.org/10.1351/pac199870102047) for manuscripts reporting the results of electronic structure calculations, force field parameters, and other potential energy surface information. Further details are listed in the guidelines authored by J. E. Boggs (Pure Appl. Chem. 1998, 70, No. 4, 1015–1018 (http://dx.doi.org/10.1351/pac199870041015). Both sets of guidelines can be viewed online at http://iupac.org/publications/pac/reports/year/1998/. While these papers refer to electronic structure and molecular dynamics calculations, the concepts stated below apply to all calculations.

If a paper mentions any calculations that are integral to the study (i.e., the precise quantitative results are central to the conclusions drawn) computational details must be described.
Reproducibility of computations should be a defining goal in reporting computational results. Sufficient technical details should be provided to allow a reader to reproduce the results of any calculations. Of course, strict reproducibility of computations may be precluded by differences among computers (e.g., differences in operating systems, host-based algorithms, machine precision, etc.), software (e.g., installation procedures and programming modifications), and applications (e.g., for probabilistic methods such as Monte Carlo calculations).
A description of the results of any published calculation must be available for scientific scrutiny by other investigators. Ordinarily this will best be achieved if the authors place full details of the calculation (e.g., structures, energies, frequencies, dynamical quantities, etc.) in a repository (such as Supporting Information to the paper) that is accessible via the Internet. Otherwise, it is the responsibility of the investigator to make such information available upon request. Depending on the specific circumstances, the appropriate data to be deposited might be final output structure(s) or the input structure(s) that would allow another investigator to replicate the computational experiment.
Electronically deposited structures should be written in a format that is machine readable by readily available modelling or translating programs.
An adequate specification of the computer program used to carry out the calculations is essential. If the calculations were carried out with commercially available software, the investigator must list the source, version number, and force field employed. Any program modifications and any differences from the published version (including changes in parameters) must be fully described or available to other investigators upon request. Changes in parameters, program options (e.g., dielectric constant, nonbonded cutoffs, etc.) affecting reproducibility of the calculation, and program constraints must be fully described in the article. If the program is not available, commercially or otherwise, the authors must specify sufficient detail that the calculation could be reproduced.
The issue of convergence must be adequately addressed. An iterative calculation is considered to have converged when further iterations will not significantly alter the results. Convergence criteria should be reported (e.g., energy change per iteration or energy gradient for geometry optimization of a single structure). 

Guidelines for Experiments
Authors are expected to provide sufficient detail to enable a trained professional to reproduce routine measurements and synthetic procedures. Authors are required to provide crystallographic or surface structure data as Supporting Information in crystallographic information file (CIF) format. For quantitative optical measurements, the specifics and usable range of the photodetector should be reported.

",na,Code sharing encouraged but optional.,"Authors should supply enough Supporting Information to reproduce the calculations or to make the results utilizable without repeating the calculations. Computational manuscripts should include at least the following Supporting Information:

Description of specific programs and the release or version. Authors should check and comply with citation requests of the program packages used. If the author’s own or a modified version of a commercially available program is used, it is required that the program/code/modification be made available to the scientific community (QCPE, publication in a computational journal, commercially, etc.), if the license permits. Policies in this regard are identical with those of several other ACS journals, as summarized in J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2006, 46, 937.A clear exposition of any nonstandard equations and algorithms used and, where feasible, tests of the codes in various limiting cases should also be provided. 
Details of the computations. The computed molecular model should be described clearly, possibly with a ChemDraw figure. If the model is based on an experimentally known complex/reaction, any modifications (such as truncations) should be clearly described and justified. Final optimized coordinates and keywords are to be provided. For DFT computations, the choice of functional must be justified, or the validation of the functional provided. The choice of basis sets must be explicitly discussed including any deviation from standard basis sets. Convergence criteria, integration parameters, active space definition in multireference calculations, and, for open-shell systems, the way in which spin states are handled should be mentioned explicitly. The exact definition of any applied numerical or symmetry constraint should be indicated.
Details of the computational results. When relevant to the results of the study, data such as absolute energies, gross orbital populations, atomic spin densities, etc., should be supplied. Where feasible, critical checkpoint/restart files should be saved and made available upon request.
Cartesian Coordinates. Cartesian coordinates of all molecules, intermediates, transition states, etc. that are part of the manuscript must be uploaded in a single file that is formatted for convenient viewing with widely available molecular modeling packages. The .xyz and .mol formats are accepted at this time. The .xyz format is the most basic and easily prepared from computational output. More information on the .xyz file format is available at http://openbabel.sourceforge.net/wiki/XYZ.

The first line of the .xyz format file denotes the number of atoms in the molecule.

The second line of the file is a comments line, and should begin with a descriptive name of the molecule/structure consistent with the designation in the manuscript, and any other pertinent information selected by the author, such as total energy.

Next follow lines for each element in the molecule. Each line contains the element symbol followed by the x, y, and z coordinates in angstroms (Å) separated by spaces in free-field format (i.e. precise formatting not required).

Multiple structures are placed directly end-to-end in the file. The file name should have the extension “.xyz”.

It is strongly recommended that authors view the structures in the file with a modeling program before uploading the file. The program Mercury (version 3.3 or later) is recommended for viewing and manipulating the multiple structures. The Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC) offers Mercury at no cost. Include the phrase “a text file of all computed molecule Cartesian coordinates in a format for convenient visualization” in the Supporting Information statement.

6. Computational Chemistry.

6.1 Manuscript Categories. When computational chemistry is a major component of a study, manuscripts must fall into one or more of the following categories:

(A) Practical applications of existing computational methods combined with original experimental data. Manuscripts that report prospective computational design, synthesis, and experimental evaluation of new chemical entities are highly encouraged.

Applications of existing computational methods are not considered without original experimental data that assess the computational predictions. QSAR modeling is acceptable only if a significant number of new compounds is predicted, prepared, and tested. Avoid overinterpretation of computational predictions and conclusions drawn from molecular models as if they represent experimental data.

(B) Substantially novel methods along with evidence for utility in medicinal chemistry with significant potential for advancing the field.

Clearly describe computational methods to be accessible to a general medicinal chemistry audience and clarify the relevance of the new method to medicinal chemistry. Present sufficient information to allow the method to be reproduced and tested in other laboratories.

(C) Statistical analysis or mining of publicly available databases or data sets that provide unprecedented insights into the advancement of medicinal chemistry problems.

Such investigations must be based upon large data sets. Small series of compounds whose properties are reinvestigated using computational methods do not qualify for this category.

6.2 Proprietary Data. Normally, the use of proprietary data for computational modeling or analysis is not acceptable because it is inconsistent with the ACS Ethical Guidelines. All experimental data and molecular structures used to generate and/or validate computational models must be reported in the paper, reported as supporting information, or readily available without infringements or restrictions. The Editors may choose to waive the data deposition requirement for proprietary data in rare cases where studies based on large corporate data sets provide compelling insight unobtainable otherwise.

6.3 Virtual Screening Studies. Prospective virtual screen studies must meet the following acceptance criteria.

In order to validate virtual screening hits obtained from any source, provide proof of dose-response behavior, confirmation of IC50 or Ki values, and controls for nonspecific or artificial inhibition (i.e., proof of reversibility, detergent controls). Submit structure confirmation (1H NMR and MS; see section 4) for active compounds.
For target-directed virtual screens, evidence for direct binding/inhibition must be provided; the exclusive use of cell-based/functional/reporter gene assays is insufficient.
Include explicit support for the significance of experimental findings. Identifying weakly potent compounds for a given target is not considered a significant advance if many potent compounds acting by the same or a similar mechanism are already available.
Virtual screening hits must be filtered for Pan Assay Interference Compounds (PAINS; Baell and Holloway, J. Med. Chem. 2010, 53, 2719-2740) and the results must be reported in the manuscript (exemplary online filter:  http://zinc15.docking.org/patterns/home/).
For virtual screens that produce compound rankings, provide as Supporting Information for Publication the total number of compounds that were screened and the ranks of identified hits before application of any further manual or other subjective selection steps.
Complex virtual screening protocols are not validated by identifying a few active compounds. Evidence must be provided that much simpler approaches would not have yielded comparable results (e.g., 2D similarity or substructure searching).
Reported calculations must be limited to those that were essential for the identification of novel active compounds. In virtual screening studies, retrospective computational studies such as benchmarking or similar in silico validation attempts should not be reported. All computational studies that do not directly contribute to the identification of novel active compounds must be omitted.
For virtual screening studies, computational models of targets (e.g. homology models) and ligand/target complexes such as docked/modeled complexes of active compounds must be made freely available as PDB coordinate files as Supporting Information for Publication (see also 6.7).
6.4 Retrospective Use of Computational Methods. Manuscripts that contain experimental studies with a retrospective computational component will be considered only under the following conditions:

Computational work must lead to a clearly stated message, either an improved understanding of the experimental work or a well-defined experimentally testable hypothesis.
Clearly distinguish models and hypothetical statements from experimental observations both in the text and in figure captions.
Describe computational methods in sufficient detail for the reader to reproduce the results.
Draw conclusions from modeling with an appropriate amount of caution in light of assumptions made and within the accuracy limitations of the applied computational methods. The overall amount of space (text and figures) devoted to retrospective computational work must be proportionate to its significance.
6.5 Predicted Compound Binding Modes. The prediction of compound binding modes by docking is a frequent computational application submitted to the Journal in combination with experimental data. Provide PBD IDs of crystal structures used as starting points for molecular modeling in the legends of figures depicting the resulting molecular models. In the absence of supporting structural information demonstrate that putative binding modes are consistent with structure-activity relationships for a series of analogues.

QSAR, pseudo-receptor, or machine learning models that are occasionally applied retrospectively to analyze biological activities observed in the context of experimental SAR studies are acceptable only when used to illustrate a point of central relevance for a manuscript.

6.6 Benchmark Calculations. Benchmark investigations, such as comparisons of virtual screening algorithms, are considered only if they provide particularly clear and generally relevant conclusions that set new standards in the field. General relevance and new standards must be clearly stated.

6.7 PDB Coordinates for Computational Models. If three-dimensional computational models of targets, binding sites, or target-ligand complexes are reported, PDB coordinates of hydrogen-suppressed atomic models must be included as Supporting Information for Publication at submission to ensure reproducibility of calculations and reported findings.

7. QSAR/QSPR and Proprietary Data. The following are general requirements for manuscripts reporting work done in this area:

Authors should explicitly state in the abstract, introduction, and/or results sections of the paper what is novel about the quantitative structure–activity relationships/quantitative structure–property relationships (QSAR/QSPR) study being reported.
If a new method/theory is reported, it should be compared to and “validated” against at least one other common method that is widely used in the field.
   All data and molecular structures used to carry out a QSAR/QSPR study are to be reported in the paper and/or as Supporting Information for Publication. The use of proprietary data is generally not acceptable.
Standard QSAR/QSPR studies are considered only if the predictions are experimentally tested and if the experimental data are novel and significant. Only QSAR/QSPR analyses that provide new insights into the activity are considered.
Specifically discouraged are (i) QSAR and QSPR modeling for data sets that have already been extensively modeled, (ii) model development featuring high ratios of descriptors to data points, and (iii) reports of new descriptors without clear evidence for their superiority in QSAR/QSPR modeling to existing, commonly used alternatives.

8. Statistical Criteria. Appropriate statistical assessment is equally important for experimental and computational studies in medicinal chemistry. Reported results generally require statistical validation such as the use of the probability value (p-value) used to identify significance (generally p < 0.05).  Statistical analyses of compound data are also frequently presented, which must adhere to acceptable statistical and scientific standards. Specifically:

A clear and comprehensive description of experimental data or computed data underlying the analysis is required.
Statistical methods used must be clearly identified. Non-standard statistical methods should be described in sufficient detail or precisely referenced.
Underlying assumptions of statistical methods should be specified. For example, many statistical tests assume the presence of normal data distributions, which is often an approximation in practice.
Depending on the type of experiments reported, either confidence limits (CL), standard deviations (SD), or standard errors of the mean (SEM) must accompany a mean value provided in either graphical or tabular form. The experimental section for each in vitro and in vivo assay performed should indicate the number of independent experiments as well as the statistical method used for data analysis. For example, assay curves must contain errors bars derived from multiple measurements.
For regression curves, their uncertainty must be assessed by plotting the original data along the curve or by establishing experimental or calculation confidence limits.
If average values are reported from computational analysis, their variance must be documented. This can be accomplished by providing the number of times calculations have been repeated, mean values, and standard deviations (or standard errors). Alternatively, median values and percentile ranges can be provided. Data might also be summarized in scatter plots or box plots.
Reporting averages of data assigned to pre-defined value ranges and ‘averages of average values’ must be avoided.",No mention of dependencies for research code.,na,No mention of a persistent identifier or specifying a version of developed code.,na,The journal policies do not mention any code quality standards.,na,No mention of automatic testing to verify code functionality.,na,No mention of standards for code documentation.,na,No mention of linting standards for code.,na,No mention of standards for code development such as continuous integration.,na

As part of its ACS Research Data Policy, which is based upon FAIR Data Principles, ACS strongly encourages authors submitting manuscripts to its portfolio of journals to make all research data underlying their manuscripts publicly available. A Data Availability Statement is a formal way within your manuscript to indicate how others can access your research data to aid them in repeating experiments, designing new experiments, and helping advance scientific research.

Is a Data Availability Statement required for publication?
ACS is conducting a Data Availability Statement pilot program with Organic Letters, The Journal of Organic Chemistry, and ACS Organic & Inorganic Au. A Data Availability Statement is required for these three journals during the pilot program for all peer-reviewed articles. Manuscripts submitted to these journals prior to September 15, 2022 will not be included in the pilot. A Data Availability Statement is not required for other ACS journals at this time but is highly encouraged. With results from the pilot program, ACS will decide on future requirements for all its journals.

Is a Data Availability Statement required for every article?
A Data Availability Statement is required for all peer-reviewed articles in Organic Letters, The Journal of Organic Chemistry, and ACS Organic & Inorganic Au.

The acceptable uncertainty in a measurement by any analytical method must be adequate for the intended use of the data.

Evaluate the uncertainty of accurate mass measurement by any statistically valid method. Determine, for example, the precision and accuracy of replicate measurements or evaluate the performance characteristics of the mass spectrometer (see, for example, Sack, T. M., Lapp, R. L., Gross, M. L., and Kimble, B. J. Int. J. Mass Spectrom. Ion Proc. 1984, 61, 191-213).

Consider all candidates fitting the experimentally determined value and its reported uncertainty when the result of accurate mass measurement is used for formula confirmation. Do not set fixed acceptable error limits for exact mass measurement. Consider the following when using accurate mass data.

When valence rules and candidate compositions encompassing C0-100, H3-74, O0-4, and N0-4 are considered at nominal parent m/z of 118, there are no candidate formulae within 34 ppm of each other. When the ion is of m/z 750.4 and the formulae are in the range C0-100, H25-110, O0-15, and N0-15, there are 626 candidate formulae that are possible within 5 ppm. Thus, for a measurement at m/z 118, an error of only 34 ppm uniquely defines a particular formula, whereas at m/z 750, an error (and precision) of 0.018 ppm would be required to eliminate all extraneous possibilities.",na,Code sharing not mentioned.,na,No mention of dependencies for research code.,na,No mention of a persistent identifier or specifying a version of developed code.,na,The journal policies do not mention any code quality standards.,na,No mention of automatic testing to verify code functionality.,na,No mention of standards for code documentation.,na,No mention of linting standards for code.,na,No mention of standards for code development such as continuous integration.,na

Our data sharing policy

The Royal Society of Chemistry believes that where possible, all data associated with the research in a manuscript should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR), enabling other researchers to replicate and build on that research.

We strongly encourage authors to deposit the data underpinning their research in appropriate repositories.

For all submissions to Royal Society of Chemistry journals, any data required to understand and verify the research in an article must be made available on submission. To comply, we suggest authors deposit their data in an appropriate repository. Where this isn’t possible, we ask authors to include the data as part of the article Supplementary Information.

Some journals may have additional subject requirements for both sharing and/or publishing supporting data, so please ensure you check the journal specific guidelines.

Also:
Supplementary information (SI) +

Reviewers are asked to assess any ESI that is submitted alongside a manuscript. ESI is classed as any Electronic Supplementary Information that provides additional or supporting information, as well as other file/media types, including large data sets, movies etc. Please check that appropriate material is published as ESI rather than being included in the article. Any ESI supplied upon submission must be reviewed thoroughly, and to the same standard as the article.

Reviewers should refer to the Royal Society of Chemistry ESI guidelines, which explain in more detail our requirements for publication.
 
Authentication of new compounds +

Not all papers will contain Spectroscopic Information, and even among those journals that do, guidelines can vary significantly. It is therefore very important to refer to the individual journal specific guidelines, which explain in more detail our requirements for publication. Spectroscopic information can often be located in the ESI that has been submitted with the manuscript. Please make sure that the ESI is checked thoroughly so as not to miss important data.

Spectroscopic information necessary for the assignment of a structure should normally be given. How complete this information must be depends upon the circumstances; the structure of a compound obtained from an unusual reaction or isolated from a natural source needs much stronger supporting evidence than one derived by a standard reaction from a precursor with an undisputed structure.

Reviewers are asked to assess the evidence in support of the homogeneity and structure of all new compounds. No hard and fast rules can be laid down to cover all types of compounds. For example, an accurate mass measurement of a molecular ion does not provide evidence of purity of a compound and must be accompanied by independent evidence of homogeneity (for example, HPLC).
 
X-ray crystallographic work +

Not all papers will contain X-ray crystallographic work, so it is important to refer to the individual journal specific guidelines and X-ray crystallography guidelines which explain in more detail our requirements for publication. Papers containing X-ray crystallographic work will be reviewed for their chemical interest. When reviewing manuscripts containing crystal structures, reviewers are not usually expected to fully check the crystal data for accuracy, but should pay attention to the quality of the experimental crystallographic work. The editor may also choose to send the manuscript to a specialist crystallographer for specific crystallographic review.

In a Communication a structure must usually be fully refined. For a Full paper, partial refinement may be sufficient if only being used to establish connectivity, confirm a trend or if the full structure has previously been published as a Communication, at the editor’s discretion. These Full papers must reference the original Communication and relevant CCDC/ICSD numbers. If the crystallography is discussed again at length in the Full paper, the data should be presented in full and, where necessary, redeposited with the CCDC.

In some Full papers where the results of a crystal structure determination are discussed but details or extensive discussion are considered unnecessary, the data relating to the crystal structure determination may be included as electronic supplementary information (ESI), rather than discussed in detail in the manuscript. This is acceptable if there is enough data in the ESI to allow reviewers/crystallographers to confirm the reported results, and if it does not lead to unnecessary fragmentation of the work.

Not all papers will contain X-ray crystallographic work, so it is important to refer to the individual journal specific guidelines and X-ray crystallography guidelines which explain in more detail our requirements for publication. Papers containing X-ray crystallographic work will be reviewed for their chemical interest. When reviewing manuscripts containing crystal structures, reviewers are not usually expected to fully check the crystal data for accuracy, but should pay attention to the quality of the experimental crystallographic work. The editor may also choose to send the manuscript to a specialist crystallographer for specific crystallographic review.

In a Communication a structure must usually be fully refined. For a Full paper, partial refinement may be sufficient if only being used to establish connectivity, confirm a trend or if the full structure has previously been published as a Communication, at the editor’s discretion. These Full papers must reference the original Communication and relevant CCDC/ICSD numbers. If the crystallography is discussed again at length in the Full paper, the data should be presented in full and, where necessary, redeposited with the CCDC.

In some Full papers where the results of a crystal structure determination are discussed but details or extensive discussion are considered unnecessary, the data relating to the crystal structure determination may be included as electronic supplementary information (ESI), rather than discussed in detail in the manuscript. This is acceptable if there is enough data in the ESI to allow reviewers/crystallographers to confirm the reported results, and if it does not lead to unnecessary fragmentation of the work.

Our data sharing policy

The Royal Society of Chemistry believes that where possible, all data associated with the research in a manuscript should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR), enabling other researchers to replicate and build on that research.

We strongly encourage authors to deposit the data underpinning their research in appropriate repositories.

For all submissions to Royal Society of Chemistry journals, any data required to understand and verify the research in an article must be made available on submission. To comply, we suggest authors deposit their data in an appropriate repository. Where this isn’t possible, we ask authors to include the data as part of the article Supplementary Information.

Some journals may have additional subject requirements for both sharing and/or publishing supporting data, so please ensure you check the journal specific guidelines.

Reviewers are asked to assess any ESI that is submitted alongside a manuscript. ESI is classed as any Electronic Supplementary Information that provides additional or supporting information, as well as other file/media types, including large data sets, movies etc. Please check that appropriate material is published as ESI rather than being included in the article. Any ESI supplied upon submission must be reviewed thoroughly, and to the same standard as the article.

It is therefore very important to refer to the individual journal specific guidelines, which explain in more detail our requirements for publication. Spectroscopic information can often be located in the ESI that has been submitted with the manuscript. Please make sure that the ESI is checked thoroughly so as not to miss important data.

Spectroscopic information necessary for the assignment of a structure should normally be given. How complete this information must be depends upon the circumstances; the structure of a compound obtained from an unusual reaction or isolated from a natural source needs much stronger supporting evidence than one derived by a standard reaction from a precursor with an undisputed structure.

Reviewers are asked to assess the evidence in support of the homogeneity and structure of all new compounds. No hard and fast rules can be laid down to cover all types of compounds. For example, an accurate mass measurement of a molecular ion does not provide evidence of purity of a compound and must be accompanied by independent evidence of homogeneity (for example, HPLC).

",Public data sharing required only for specific types of data.,"Where deposition in a particular repository is required for submission, this is indicated in the table below.  Crystal structure (organic / organometallic / metal organic)
Required for all RSC journals

Organic compounds

Authors are required to provide unequivocal support for the purity and assigned structure of all compounds using a combination of the following characterisation techniques.

Analytical
Elemental analysis (within ±0.4% of the calculated value) is required to confirm 95% sample purity and corroborate isomeric purity. Authors are also requested to provide copies of 1H,13C NMR spectra and/or GC/HPLC traces; however, if satisfactory elemental analysis cannot be obtained, copies of these spectra and/or traces must be provided. For libraries of compounds, HPLC traces should be submitted as proof of purity. The determination of enantiomeric excess of nonracemic, chiral substances should be supported with either GC/HPLC traces with retention times for both enantiomers and separation conditions (that is, chiral support, solvent and flow rate) or for Mosher Ester/Chiral Shift Reagent analysis, copies of the spectra.

Physical
Important physical properties - for example, boiling or melting point, specific rotation, refractive index - including conditions and a comparison to the literature for known compounds should be provided. For crystalline compounds, the method used for recrystallisation should also be documented (that is, solvent etc).

Spectroscopic
Mass spectra and a complete numerical listing of 1H,13C NMR peaks in support of the assigned structure, including relevant 2D NMR and related experiments (that is, NOE, etc) is required. As noted in 'Analytical', authors are requested to provide copies of these spectra. Infrared spectra that support functional group modifications, including other diagnostic assignments, should be included. High-resolution mass spectra are acceptable as proof of the molecular weight providing the purity of the sample has been accurately determined as outlined above.
Polymers

For all soluble polymers, an estimation of molecular weight must be provided by a suitable method - for example, size exclusion chromatography, including details of columns, eluents and calibration standards, intrinsic viscosity, MALDI TOF, etc. In addition, full NMR characterisation (1H,13C) as for organic compound characterisation (see 'Organic compounds' in this section) should be included. Small molecules on the route to the polymers should be characterised as above and NMR data should be tabulated.
Inorganic and organometallic compounds

A new chemical substance (molecule or extended solid) should have a homogeneous composition and structure. Where the compound is molecular, authors must provide data to unequivocally establish its homogeneity, purity and identification. In general, this should include elemental analyses that agree to within ±0.4% of the calculated values. In cases where elemental analyses cannot be obtained (for example, for thermally unstable compounds), justification for the omission of this data should be provided. Note that an X-ray crystal structure is not sufficient for the characterisation of a new material, since the crystal used in this analysis does not necessarily represent the bulk sample.

In rare cases, it may be possible to substitute elemental analyses with high-resolution mass spectrometric molecular weights. This is appropriate, for example, with trivial derivatives of thoroughly characterised substances or routine synthetic intermediates. In all cases, relevant spectroscopic data (NMR, IR, UV-vis, etc) should be provided in tabulated form or as reproduced spectra. These may be relegated to the electronic supplementary information (ESI) to conserve journal space. However, it should be noted that, in general, mass spectrometric and spectroscopic data do not constitute proof of purity, and, in the absence of elemental analyses, additional evidence of purity should be provided (melting points, PXRD data, etc).

Where the compound is an extended solid, it is important to unequivocally establish the chemical structure and bulk composition. Single crystal diffraction does not determine the bulk structure. Referees will normally look to see evidence of bulk homogeneity. A fully indexed powder diffraction pattern that agrees with single crystal data may be used as evidence of a bulk homogeneous structure, and chemical analysis may be used to establish purity and homogeneous composition.
Magnetic measurements

If data from magnetic measurements are presented, the manuscript must provide a thorough description of the experimental details pertaining to how the sample was measured (in a gelatin capsule, Teflon capsule, as a powder, etc). If the data have been corrected for sample or sample-holder diamagnetism, the diamagnetic correction term must be provided and the manner in which it was determined (for example, calculated using Pascal’s constants, measured) must be stated.

Any fit of magnetic data [for example, χ(T), χ(1/T), χT(T), μ(T), M(H), etc] to an analytical expression must be accompanied by the Hamiltonian from which the analytical expression is derived, the analytical expression itself, and the fitting parameters. If the expression is lengthy, it may be included in the electronic supplementary information instead of within the main manuscript text. Its inclusion as supplementary information should be noted in the electronic supplementary information paragraph at the end of the manuscript. When an exchange coupling constant (J) is quoted in the abstract, the form of the Hamiltonian must also be included in the abstract.
Nano-sized materials (such as quantum dots, nanoparticles, nanotubes, nanowires)

It is essential that the authors not only provide detailed characterisation on individual objects (see 'Inorganic and organometallic compounds') but also a comprehensive characterisation of the bulk composition. Characterisation of the bulk of the sample could require determination of the chemical composition and size distribution over large portions of the sample.
Biomolecules (for example, enzymes, proteins, DNA/RNA, oligosaccharides, oligonucleotides)

Authors should provide rigorous evidence for the identity and purity of the biomolecules described. The techniques that may be employed to substantiate identity include the following.

    Mass spectrometry
    LC-MS
    Sequencing data (for proteins and oligonucleotides)
    High field 1H,13C NMR spectroscopy
    X-ray crystallography

Purity must be established by one or more of the following.

    HPLC
    Gel electrophoresis
    Capillary electrophoresis
    High field 1H,13C NMR spectroscopy

Sequence verification also needs to be carried out for nucleic acid cases involving molecular biology including all mutants; for new protein or gene sequences, the entire sequence must be provided. For organic synthesis involving DNA, RNA oligonucleotides, their derivatives or mimics, purity must be established using HPLC and mass spectrometry as a minimum.

For new derivatives comprising modified monomers, the usual organic chemistry analytical requirements for the novel monomer must be provided (see 'Organic compounds'). However, it is not necessary to provide this level of characterisation for the oligonucleotide into which the novel monomer is incorporated.
Computational results

Authors must provide sufficient information to enable readers to reproduce any computational results. If software was used for calculations and is generally available, it must be properly cited in the notes and references. References to the methods upon which the software is based must also be provided. Equations, data, geometric parameters/coordinates, or other numerical parameters essential to reproduction of the computational results (or adequate references when available in the open literature) must be provided. Authors who report the results of electronic structure calculations in relative energies should also include in electronic supplementary information the absolute energies obtained directly from the computational output files.

Spectroscopic information necessary for the assignment of a structure should normally be given. How complete this information must be depends upon the circumstances; the structure of a compound obtained from an unusual reaction or isolated from a natural source needs much stronger supporting evidence than one derived by a standard reaction from a precursor with an undisputed structure.

Reviewers are asked to assess the evidence in support of the homogeneity and structure of all new compounds. No hard and fast rules can be laid down to cover all types of compounds. For example, an accurate mass measurement of a molecular ion does not provide evidence of purity of a compound and must be accompanied by independent evidence of homogeneity (for example, HPLC).
 
X-ray crystallographic work +

Not all papers will contain X-ray crystallographic work, so it is important to refer to the individual journal specific guidelines and X-ray crystallography guidelines which explain in more detail our requirements for publication. Papers containing X-ray crystallographic work will be reviewed for their chemical interest. When reviewing manuscripts containing crystal structures, reviewers are not usually expected to fully check the crystal data for accuracy, but should pay attention to the quality of the experimental crystallographic work. The editor may also choose to send the manuscript to a specialist crystallographer for specific crystallographic review.

In a Communication a structure must usually be fully refined. For a Full paper, partial refinement may be sufficient if only being used to establish connectivity, confirm a trend or if the full structure has previously been published as a Communication, at the editor’s discretion. These Full papers must reference the original Communication and relevant CCDC/ICSD numbers. If the crystallography is discussed again at length in the Full paper, the data should be presented in full and, where necessary, redeposited with the CCDC.

In some Full papers where the results of a crystal structure determination are discussed but details or extensive discussion are considered unnecessary, the data relating to the crystal structure determination may be included as electronic supplementary information (ESI), rather than discussed in detail in the manuscript. This is acceptable if there is enough data in the ESI to allow reviewers/crystallographers to confirm the reported results, and if it does not lead to unnecessary fragmentation of the work.

Our data sharing policy

The Royal Society of Chemistry believes that where possible, all data associated with the research in a manuscript should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR), enabling other researchers to replicate and build on that research.

We strongly encourage authors to deposit the data underpinning their research in appropriate repositories.

For all submissions to Royal Society of Chemistry journals, any data required to understand and verify the research in an article must be made available on submission. To comply, we suggest authors deposit their data in an appropriate repository. Where this isn’t possible, we ask authors to include the data as part of the article Supplementary Information.

Some journals may have additional subject requirements for both sharing and/or publishing supporting data, so please ensure you check the journal specific guidelines.",Public data sharing required only for specific types of data.,"Where deposition in a particular repository is required for submission, this is indicated in the table below.  Crystal structure (organic / organometallic / metal organic)

We at the Royal Society of Chemistry believe that where possible, all data associated with the research in a manuscript should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR), enabling other researchers to replicate and build on that research. Authors are expected to submit both their code and data supporting their manuscript to community-recognized data repositories or a general repository if no community resource is available. Referees have to be able to access code and data during the peer-review process, and public release should be coordinated with the publication of the manuscript.  

Papers describing hardware should be accompanied by detailed supporting information, including a comprehensive bill of materials and a construction guide. All design files and software code should be hosted in a public, persistent repository, ensuring easy access and longevity of the resources. In addition to any finished products, authors should provide relevant files in editable format.

All research articles submitted to Digital Discovery must be accompanied by a data availability statement (DAS) which provides information about where data, software and code supporting the results reported in a published article can be found (more information can be found in the ‘Data availability statement’ section below).

If authors are unable to publicly share their code and data due to employer policies or previous arrangements they still need to release as much data and tools as possible (datasets, analysis scripts, etc.) and detail the reasons for the omission of other resources in the data availability statement. The reasons for restrictions on data and code sharing will be assessed by the editor at submission who reserves the right to reject the manuscript if these conditions are excessively prohibitive.

Under any circumstances, all supporting data and code must be made available to editors and peer reviewers at the time of submission for the purposes of evaluating the manuscript.
Data availability statements

In order to maintain high standards of transparency, research reproducibility, and to promote the reuse of new findings a data availability statement (DAS) is required to be submitted alongside all articles. The DAS should include, where applicable, links to code and datasets which have been analysed or generated during the study and shared in an external data repository.",DOIs or other persistent identifiers recommended for datasets or codes.,"Where deposition in a particular repository is required for submission, this is indicated in the table below.

We encourage authors to deposit their datasets in publicly available repositories (where available and appropriate) or present them in the main manuscript.

What is a data availability statement?

A data availability statements tells the reader where the data associated with a paper is available, and where applicable, includes links to the data set.

What counts as data?

By data we mean the minimal dataset that would be necessary to interpret, replicate, and build upon the findings reported in the article. Some communities may have more specific standards and definition of data.

Which journals does this policy apply to?

Data availability statements are required for research published in all AIP Publishing journals.

How should I write a data availability statement?

AIP Publishing has prepared a set of standard templates that you can use or adapt. Please review the author guidelines for examples.

Why should I use a data repository?

Data repositories make data more accessible and discoverable than sharing data via supplementary information files. Public repositories generally assign a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) to datasets which allows them to be cited in reference lists. Repositories also support domain-specific data reporting standards and provide standardized ways of structuring and identifying data.

How do I choose a data repository?

Some research communities are served by specific data repositories; your institutional librarian, funder, or journal editor may make a recommendation. Researchers can also use a general repository – such as Zenodo, figshare or Dryad – that accept data from all disciplines. Certified repositories can also be found through the Registry of Research Data Repositories (re3data.org), FAIRsharing.org, or CoreTrustSeal.

Can institutional repositories be used for data?

AIP Publishing authors may host their data in their institutional or project specific repository.",Data sharing required but not publicly (e.g. available upon request is allowed).,"Below is a list of standard templates for the text that will appear in the “Data Availability Statement” portion of your article.  When multiple data sets are being described, please provide information regarding the data type for the benefit of the reader.

MDPI Research Data Policies

MDPI is committed to supporting open scientific exchange and enabling our authors to achieve best practices in sharing and archiving research data. We encourage all authors of articles published in MDPI journals to share their research data including, but not limited to protocols, analytic methods, raw data, processed data, code, software, algorithms, and study material. The data should be FAIR – findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable – so that other researchers can locate and use the data.

We recommend that data and code should be deposited in a trusted repository that will allow for maximum reuse (see the Data Preservation section below). If this is not possible, authors are encouraged to share the specific reason in the Data Availability Statement and make this material available upon request to interested researchers. In addition, research materials necessary to enable the reproduction of an experiment should be indicated in the Materials and Methods section. Individual journal guidelines can be found at the journal ‘Instructions for Authors’ page. Data sharing policies concern the minimal dataset that supports the central findings of a published study. Generated data should be publicly available and cited in accordance with journal guidelines.

MDPI data policies are informed by TOP Guidelines.

Where ethical, legal, or privacy issues are present, data should not be shared. The authors should clarify the availability status of the data upon submission and make any limitations or exceptions clear in the Data Availability Statement. Authors should ensure that the data shared is in accordance with consent provided by participants on the use of confidential data. Authors should ensure that the publication of such data does not compromise the anonymity of the participants or breach local data protection laws.

In situations where access is restricted to protect confidential or proprietary information, authors will be requested to clearly explain the restrictions on the dataset and make the data available upon request, with permission for the purposes of peer review.

MDPI recognizes that some institutions and funding agencies only require the retention of research data for a finite period after a project’s completion or publication. However, there are no such limits specified within the MDPI Data Availability Policy and, therefore, we encourage the authors to archive their research data through appropriate data repositories or provide us with minimal datasets within Supplementary Material.",Journal policies require stating all dependencies and their versions that were used to run computational experiments.,"We recommend that data and code should be deposited in a trusted repository that will allow for maximum reuse (see the Data Preservation section below).

MDPI Research Data Policies

MDPI is committed to supporting open scientific exchange and enabling our authors to achieve best practices in sharing and archiving research data. We encourage all authors of articles published in MDPI journals to share their research data including, but not limited to protocols, analytic methods, raw data, processed data, code, software, algorithms, and study material. The data should be FAIR – findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable – so that other researchers can locate and use the data.

We recommend that data and code should be deposited in a trusted repository that will allow for maximum reuse (see the Data Preservation section below). If this is not possible, authors are encouraged to share the specific reason in the Data Availability Statement and make this material available upon request to interested researchers. In addition, research materials necessary to enable the reproduction of an experiment should be indicated in the Materials and Methods section. Individual journal guidelines can be found at the journal ‘Instructions for Authors’ page. Data sharing policies concern the minimal dataset that supports the central findings of a published study. Generated data should be publicly available and cited in accordance with journal guidelines.

MDPI data policies are informed by TOP Guidelines.

Where ethical, legal, or privacy issues are present, data should not be shared. The authors should clarify the availability status of the data upon submission and make any limitations or exceptions clear in the Data Availability Statement. Authors should ensure that the data shared is in accordance with consent provided by participants on the use of confidential data. Authors should ensure that the publication of such data does not compromise the anonymity of the participants or breach local data protection laws.

In situations where access is restricted to protect confidential or proprietary information, authors will be requested to clearly explain the restrictions on the dataset and make the data available upon request, with permission for the purposes of peer review.

MDPI recognizes that some institutions and funding agencies only require the retention of research data for a finite period after a project’s completion or publication. However, there are no such limits specified within the MDPI Data Availability Policy and, therefore, we encourage the authors to archive their research data through appropriate data repositories or provide us with minimal datasets within Supplementary Material.",Public data sharing on a FAIR repository not mentioned in RDP.,not mentioned ,Required according to the RDP.,"Data availability statements

Data availability statements are required for all articles published with MDPI. During the peer review and editorial decision process, authors can be asked to share existing datasets or raw data that have been analyzed in the manuscript, and whether they will be made available to other researchers following publication. Authors will also be asked for the details of any existing datasets that have been analyzed in the manuscript.",DOIs or other persistent identifiers recommended for datasets or codes.,"Data repository criteria

We encourage all authors of articles published in MDPI journals to share their research data including, but not limited to protocols, analytic methods, raw data, processed data, code, software, algorithms, and study material. The data should be FAIR – findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable – so that other researchers can locate and use the data.
We recommend that data and code should be deposited in a trusted repository that will allow for maximum reuse (see the Data Preservation section below).

Data availability statements are required for all articles published with MDPI. During the peer review and editorial decision process, authors can be asked to share existing datasets or raw data that have been analyzed in the manuscript, and whether they will be made available to other researchers following publication. Authors will also be asked for the details of any existing datasets that have been analyzed in the manuscript.

Below are the recommended Data Availability Statements:

MDPI encourages the submission of data to community-recognized data repositories where possible. We recommend the authors visit re3data.org or fairsharing.org to help identify registered and certified data repositories relevant to their subject area if no community resource is available. If the authors’ institution has its generalist data repository this can be used to host authors’ data as long as the repository can mint DataCite DOIs, and allows for data to be shared under open terms of use (for example the CC0 waiver).

Data repository criteria

The following criteria should be considered when selecting an appropriate repository, ensuring that platforms:

Ensure long-term persistence and preservation of datasets in their published form;
Provide stable identifiers for submitted datasets (DOIs in most cases);
Allow public access to data without barriers, such as logins or paywalls;

1 A data availability statement confirms the presence or absence of shared data.

2 Links to data in data availability statements are checked to ensure they link to the data that the authors intended. If data have been shared in a data repository, the data availability statement includes a permanent link to the data. Shared data is also cited.

3 Quality and/or replicability of linked data are peer reviewed. Depending on the journal, this may be to peer review the quality of the data by ensuring that the results in the paper and the data in the repository align (for example, sample sizes and variables match), or it may be to peer review the replicability of the data to ensure that the claims presented in the journal article are valid and can be reproduced.

Encourages Data Sharing

The journal encourages authors to share the data and other artefacts supporting the results in the paper by archiving it in an appropriate public repository. Authors may provide a data availability statement, including a link to the repository they have used, in order that this statement can be published in their paper. Shared data should be cited. All accepted manuscripts may elect to publish a data availability statement to confirm the presence or absence of shared data. For authors who have shared data: this statement will describe how the data can be accessed, and include a persistent identifier (e.g., a DOI for the data, or an accession number) from the repository where you shared the data. You may use the Standard Templates for Author Use or draft your own.

Expects Data Sharing

The journal expects that data supporting the results in the paper will be archived in an appropriate public repository. Authors are required to provide a data availability statement to describe the availability or the absence of shared data. When data have been shared, authors are required to include in their data availability statement a link to the repository they have used, and to cite the data they have shared. Whenever possible the scripts and other artefacts used to generate the analyses presented in the paper should also be publicly archived. If sharing data compromises ethical standards or legal requirements then authors are not expected to share it.

See the Standard Templates for Author Use section below to select an appropriate data availability statement for your dataset.

Mandates Data Sharing

The journal requires, as a condition for publication, that the data supporting the results in the paper will be archived in an appropriate public repository. Authors are required to provide a data availability statement, including a link to the repository they have used, and to cite the data they have shared. Whenever possible the scripts and other artefacts used to generate the analyses presented in the paper should also be publicly archived. Exceptions may be granted at the discretion of the editor, for example, if sharing data compromises privacy of human data, ethical standards or legal requirements. If authors are unable to share data (for example, if sharing data compromises ethical standards or legal requirements) then authors are not required to share it and must describe restrictions in their data availability statement.

Mandates Data Sharing and Peer Reviews Data

The journal requires, as a condition for publication, that the data supporting the results in the paper will be peer reviewed and archived in an appropriate public repository. Authors are required to provide a data availability statement, including a link to the repository they have used, and to cite the data they have shared. Whenever possible the scripts and other artefacts used to generate the analyses presented in the paper should also be publicly archived. Exceptions may be granted at the discretion of the editor. If sharing data compromises ethical standards or legal requirements then authors are not required to share it.

And:

Peer review of empirical data will be conducted to confirm the quality of the shared data, for example, that sample sizes match, that the variables described in the article are present as fields in the data repository, that data is complete; that data is properly labelled and described; and that it has the appropriate metadata for the kind of data being shared.

Or:

Peer review of empirical data will be conducted to confirm that the data reproduce the analytic results reported in the paper.

",No mention of data/code licenses in RDP.,"Just general statement for article: - OPEN ACCESS. This section is included if the article is published in open access mode. In that case, the Creative Commons license should be indicated.",Data sharing policy mentioned in refereeing guidelines.,"Please note that we expect our reviewers to review all data, including any extended data and supplementary information. Is the reporting of data and methodology sufficiently detailed and transparent to enable reproducing the results?","Supply all supplementary material in standard file formats. Specialized format such as .pdb (chemical), .wrl (VRML), .nb (Mathematica notebook), and .tex can also be supplied.
-XRD data are presented as the structural formula of a molecule with numbered atoms or as a crystal lattice and tables. Along with crystallographic data (cell parameters, space group, etc.), in the experimental part, authors should specify the device with which the measurements were performed and the methods (programs) used for decrypting structures and for calculations
It is recommended to present spectroscopic data as follows: 
- In electron spectra, wavelengths (in nm) or wavenumbers (in cm–1 ) are given on the abscissa in ascending order from left to right. The logarithm of the molar absorption coefficient or, if needed, molar absorption coefficient is presented on the ordinate axis. In the text and tables, the positions of extrema are designated as λmax and λmin  IR and Raman spectra themselves are usually not presented. They are described in order of decreasing wavenumbers. An example of such a description is as follows. IR spectrum, ν, cm –1 : 3350 br (NH, NOH), 2100 o.s (C≡N), 1700–1600 s (C=O, C=N). If the spectra are given, the wavenumbers (cm–1 ) (in descending order from left to right) or frequencies in accordance with the scale of the spectrometer are placed along the lower abscissa axis; the upper abscissa axis can reflect wavelength data (µm). The left ordinate axis presents transmittance (%) or absorbance (for IR spectra) or intensity (for Raman spectra)  In NMR spectra, millionths of a field (ppm) are given on the abscissa axis; the maximum signal of a solvent or a reference sample may be outside the graph field. It is recommended to present scaled-down photocopies of the experimental spectra. In describing spectra, signal types are indicated in abbreviated form: s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; q, quartet; quint, quintet; and m, multiplet. Proton chemical shifts are given in the δ scale, for example, δ 5.24 m. Chemical shifts of nuclei 13C, 31P, etc., are given in accordance with IUPAC recommendations: a shift into the weak field with a “+;” and into a strong field, with a “–.” Signals are recorded in order of increasing δ values
-Mass spectra are presented as numerical values m/z and relative intensities of ion currents in a row, in order of decreasing ion mass, 
- In the case of GC, the brand and model of instrument, detector, and recording conditions, i.e., temperature, length and diameter of the column, column packing, solid inert carrier, and carrier gas, should be specified in the experimental part. For HPLC, it is necessary to indicate the brand and model of the instrument, the detector, temperature, length and diameter of the column, the brand and particle size of the sorbent, and the composition of the eluent. For TLC, the adsorbent, eluent, and developing reagent should be given.
","For all newly synthesized compounds, the elemental analysis data or high-resolution mass spectra should be provided",Code sharing encouraged but optional.,All authors are requested to make sure that all data and materials as well as software application or custom code support their published claims and comply with field standards,Journal policies encourage/recommend stating all dependencies and their versions that were used to run computational experiments.,All authors are requested to make sure that all data and materials as well as software application or custom code support their published claims and comply with field standards,Journal policies encourage/recommend a persistent identifier or specifying a version of developed code.,"Research Resource Identifiers (RRID) are persistent unique identifiers (effectively similar to a DOI) for research resources.

Use of Human Subjects or Animals in Research.

The American Chemical Society Publications rules and ethical guidelines provide mandatory standards of practice in experimental studies performed using biological samples obtained from animals or human subjects. Studies submitted for publication approval must present evidence that the described experimental activities have undergone local institutional review assessing safety and humane usage of study subject animals. In the case of human subjects authors must also provide a statement that study samples were obtained through the informed consent of the donors, or in lieu of that evidence, by the authority of the institutional board that licensed the use of such material. The institution’s name and approved IRB number must be listed in the paper. Papers that include any aspect of Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) or citizen science must include information on practices employed protects vulnerable populations.  ""
